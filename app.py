To Whom It May Concern,

My name's Ryan, and I'm interested in becoming a software engineer. My first
degree was in biology, but I pivoted to software engineering after graduating,
and began studying Computer Science at Oregon State University. I love to learn
and I love the puzzle-like problem-solving aspects of software engineering. As
an engineer, I am partial to backend engineering. I love to mess with the
'guts' of software, and work with the internal logic that makes it all come
together. Above all, I'm most interested in working somewhere where I can learn
and grow as much as possible. The stack is not so important to me as the
ability to improve my skills, work with smart people, and grow as a person and
as an engineer. 

Whoever reads this, I hope we get the chance to talk more and discuss how I
might be able to contribute to your company and learn some awesome things.

For contact details, please see the resume page on the '/' route. Thanks!


Ryan\n\n

Hi there! Here's some extra info about my educational background:

Bachelor's Degree - Biology - Purdue University
Dates: August 2015 - May 2019
GPA: 3.8
Details: At Purdue, I studied biology. My primary focus was on molecular and
cell biology. This includes applied molecular biology, endocrinoloy, etc.

Bachelor's Degree - Computer Science - Oregon State University
Dates: January 2020 - August 2021
GPA: 4.0
Details: After Purdue, I joined the OSU Post-Bacc CS program. The core program
primarily focuses on software engineering and general CS fundamentals, and I am
taking network and cloud development electives.\n\n

Software Engineering Intern - Bluestaq LLC
Dates: June 1 - ???, 2021
Details: This is my summer internship for the year 2021. I will be
working with Java/Maven enterprise systems in the aerospace domain. 
Official details are currently uncertain.

Undergraduate Learning Assistant - Oregon State University
Dates: March 2020 - Present
Details: As a ULA at OSU, I help teach an introductory programming course. As a
general rule, I grade assignments weekly and give feedback on the code, whether
it's an error correction or an idea about how the code could be optimized or
modified to fit convention. I also have office hours each week where I help
students to get through the assignments or just answer questions about
programming in general.

Teaching Assistant - Purdue University
Dates: January 2019 - August 2019
Details: As a TA at Purdue, I taught multiple live-coding labs in Python
object-oriented programming, as well as graded homework and held office hours.
The labs often included a lengthy problem meant to be solved in about two hours
which I supervised and helped with. Office hours involved me helping with long
projects students were assigned over multiple weeks, which often were small
games with GUIs. During this time, I was also asked to help design assignments
and exams for a new introductory data science class which made use of scipy, 
pandas, numpy, and the like.\n\n
